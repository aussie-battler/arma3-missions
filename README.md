Arma 3 missions that I have created over the years.

I have decided to go through all of the viable missions and revamp them. Many were created when I did not have an appreciation for quality programming styling and programming knowledge.

* Zeus Escape: Malden
    * Originally created 2018
    * Last updated June 15, 2022
    * Tested with multiplier: not yet
    * Escape Malden via air or sea. Enemies are controlled by Zeus. Requires at at least one Zeus game manager to play.
* Paintball: VR
    * Originally created 2014
    * Last Updated: June 17, 2022
    * Tested with multiplier: not yet
    * Originally there were seperate missions for night-time laser tag and day-time paintball and seperate arenas. Now, there is a single mission with parameters to switch between day and night, and VR-style arena or paintball-style arena. Also is procedurally generated.
* Last Armory: Stratis
    * Originally created June 2020
    * Last updated: June 26, 2022
    * Hopefully the last "armory" mission that I need to make. Allows the use of all vehicles and weapons, and also allows teleporting from spawn, on-demand sector control missions and wave clearance games.
    * First mission that I went in-depth to make the netcode work for a dedicated server as well as player-hosted. This mission should be used as an example for future missions.
    * Also actually had to make a prime factorization script. Never thought an interview question would be actually used...
