Arma 3 missions that I have created over the years.

I have decided to go through all of the viable missions and revamp them. Many were created when I did not have an appreciation for quality programming styling and programming knowledge.

* Zeus Escape: Malden
    * Originally created 2018
    * Last updated June 15, 2022
    * Tested with multiplier: not yet
    * Escape Malden via air or sea. Enemies are controlled by Zeus. Requires at at least one Zeus game manager to play.
* Paintball: VR
    * Originally created 2014

    * Originally there were seperate missions for night-time laser tag and day-time paintball and seperate arenas. Now, there is a single mission with parameters to switch between day and night, and VR-style arena or paintball-style arena. Also is procedurally generated.
